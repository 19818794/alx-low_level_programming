# C - More pointers, arrays and strings

The aim is to learn how to use pointers, arrays, and strings; and how to manipulate them.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename             | Description
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-strcat.c`         | concatenates two strings.
| `1-strncat.c`        | concatenates two strings except that it will use at most n bytes from the second string.
| `2-strncpy.c`        | copies a string.
| `3-strcmp.c`         | compares two strings.
| `4-rev_array.c`      | reverses the content of an array of integers.
| `5-string_toupper.c` | changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
| `6-cap_string.c`     | capitalizes all words of a string.
| `7-leet.c`           | encodes a string into 1337 only using one if, two loops, no switch, and no ternary operation.
| `100-rot13.c`        | encodes a string using rot13 only using one if, two loops, no switch, and no ternary operation.
| `101-print_number.c` | prints an integer only using `_putchar`, no long, no arrays or pointers, and no hard-code special values.
| `102-magic.c`        | adds one line to the code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
| `103-infinite_add.c` | adds two numbers.
| `104-print_buffer.c` | prints a buffer.
| `main.h`             | header file includes the prototypes of all functions.
| `_putchar.c`         | writes a character to stdout (we will not push it every time. Kindly check project `0x02-functions_nested_loops`).
