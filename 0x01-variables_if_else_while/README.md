# C - Variables, if, else, while

The aim is to learn about variables, if condition, while loop, ASCII table, and the output function putchar.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename                   | Description
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-positive_or_negative.c` | prints whether the random number stored in the variable n is null, positive or negative.
| `1-last_digit.c`           | prints the last digit of a random number stored in the variable n.
| `2-print_alphabet.c`       | prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` twice.
| `3-print_alphabets.c`      | prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` three times.
| `4-print_alphabt.c`        | prints the alphabet except `e` and `q` in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` twice.
| `5-print_numbers.c`        | prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
| `6-print_numberz.c`        | prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line using `putchar` twice.
| `7-print_tebahpla.c`       | prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line using `putchar` twice.
| `8-print_base16.c`         | prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` three times.
| `9-print_comb.c`           | prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using `putchar` four times.
| `100-print_comb3.c`        | prints all possible different combinations of two digits using `putchar` five times.
| `101-print_comb4.c`        | prints all possible different combinations of three digits using `putchar` six times.
| `102-print_comb5.c`        | prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers using `putchar` eight times.
