# C - More malloc, free

The aim is to learn how to use the exit, calloc, and realloc functions.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename             | Description
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-malloc_checked.c` | allocates memory using malloc.
| `1-string_nconcat.c` | concatenates two strings.
| `2-calloc.c`         | allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
| `3-array_range.c`    | creates an array of integers.
| `100-realloc.c`      | reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.
| `101-mul.c`          | multiplies two positive numbers.
| `main.h`             | header file includes the prototypes of all functions.
| `_putchar.c`         | writes a character to stdout (we will not push it every time. Kindly check project `0x02-functions_nested_loops`).
