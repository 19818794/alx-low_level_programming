# C - Hash tables

This project aims to learn about hash tables, hash function, their advantages and drawbacks, how they work and how to use them, their most common use cases, and the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C and Shell:

| Filename                | Description
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-hash_table_create.c` | creates a hash table.
| `hash_tables.h`         | header file includes libraries, structures, and the prototypes of all functions.
| `1-djb2.c`              | creates a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
| `2-key_index.c`         | gives you the index of a key.
