# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

The aim is to learn how to use and manipulate pointers to pointers, 2D arrays, and the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C and shell:

| Filename               | Description
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-memset.c`           | fills memory with a constant byte.
| `1-memcpy.c`           | copies memory area.
| `2-strchr.c`           | locates a character in a string.
| `3-strspn.c`           | gets the length of a prefix substring.
| `4-strpbrk.c`          | searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
| `5-strstr.c`           | locates a substring.
| `7-print_chessboard.c` | prints the chessboard.
| `8-print_diagsums.c`   | prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
| `100-set_string.c`     | sets the value of a pointer to a char.
| `101-crackme_password` | shell script contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
| `crackme2`             | a program in which `101-crackme_password` contains a valid password for it.
| `main.h`               | header file includes the prototypes of all functions.
| `_putchar.c`           | writes a character to stdout (we will not push it every time. Kindly check project `0x02-functions_nested_loops`).
