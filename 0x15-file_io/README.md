# C - File I/O

The aim is to learn file handling basics: open, close, read, and write files. To understand file descriptors and how to use flags, and how to set file permissions when creating a file with open.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename                  | Description
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
| `0-read_textfile.c`       | reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
| `1-create_file.c`         | creates a file.
| `2-append_text_to_file.c` | appends text at the end of a file.
| `main.h`	            | header file includes libraries and the prototypes of all functions.
