# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

The aim is to learn how to use pointers, arrays, and strings; and how to manipulate them.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename          | Description
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-reset_to_98.c` | updates the value it points to to 98.
| `1-swap.c`        | swaps the values of two integers.
| `2-strlen.c`      | returns the length of a string.
| `3-puts.c`        | prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
| `4-print_rev.c`   | prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
| `5-rev_string.c`  | reverses a string.
| `6-puts2.c`       | prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
| `7-puts_half.c`   | prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
| `8-print_array.c` | prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
| `9-strcpy.c`      | copies the string including the terminating null byte (\0) to the buffer pointed to by other pointer.
| `100-atoi.c`      | convert a string to an integer.
| `101-keygen.c`    | generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.
| `101-crackme`     | a program in which `101-keygen.c` generates a valid password for it.
| `main.h`          | header file includes the prototypes of all functions.
| `_putchar.c`      | writes a character to stdout (we will not push it every time. Kindly check project `0x02-functions_nested_loops`).
