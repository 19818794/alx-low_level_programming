# C - More functions, more nested loops

The aim is to learn about how to use nested loops and including header files.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename                 | Description
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
| `0-isupper.c`            | checks for uppercase character.
| `1-isdigit.c`            | checks for a digit (0 through 9).
| `2-mul.c`                | multiplies two integers.
| `3-print_numbers.c`      | prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line using `_putchar` twice.
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` | prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4 followed by a new line using `_putchar` twice.
| `5-more_numbers.c`       | prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line using `_putchar` three times.
| `6-print_line.c`         | draws a straight line in the terminal using `_putchar`.
| `7-print_diagonal.c`     | draws a diagonal line on the terminal using `_putchar`.
| `8-print_square.c`       | prints a square, followed by a new line using `_putchar`.
| `9-fizz_buzz.c`          | prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except multiples of 3 print `Fizz` and of 5 `Buzz`, and of both `FizzBuzz` followed by a new line using `_putchar`.
| `10-print_triangle.c`    | prints a triangle, followed by a new line using `_putchar`.
| `100-prime_factor.c`     | finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
| `101-print_number.c`     | prints an integer using `_putchar`.
| `main.h`                 | header file includes the prototypes of all functions.
| `_putchar.c`             | writes a character to stdout (we will not push it every time. Kindly check project `0x02-functions_nested_loops`).
