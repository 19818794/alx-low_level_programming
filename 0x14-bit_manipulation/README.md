# C - Bit manipulation

The aim is to learn how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename               | Description
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-binary_to_uint.c`   | converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
| `1-print_binary.c`     | prints the binary representation of a number.
| `2-get_bit.c`          | calculates the value of a bit at a given index.
| `3-set_bit.c`          | sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
| `4-clear_bit.c`        | sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
| `5-flip_bits.c`        | calculates the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
| `100-get_endianness.c` | checks byte order information about the CPU architecture.
| `101-password`         | finds the password for a program.
| `crackme3`             | a program in which 101-password saved a valid password for it.
| `_putchar.c`           | writes a character to stdout (we will not push it every time. Kindly check project 0x02-functions_nested_loops).
| `main.h`	         | header file includes libraries and the prototypes of all functions.
