# C - Debugging

The aim is to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually instead of using debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have.

# Technologies

tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

C files are complied using gcc 9.4.0.

C files are written according to the GNU C89 dialect, which includes some extensions beyond the standard C89.

# Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename                   | Description
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
| `0-main.c`                 | test whether the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
| `1-main.c`                 | comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
| `2-largest_number.c`       | fix the function so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
| `3-print_remaining_days.c` | fix the function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
| `main.h`                   | header file includes the prototypes of all functions.
